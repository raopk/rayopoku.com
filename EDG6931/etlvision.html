                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">When I was asked to predict a 
                                technology most likely to be widely adopted for education 
                                in the future, I predicted holograms. At the time, I was confident 
                                that the shiny new technology would replace classroom teachers. 
                                It’s been a few years, and we have yet to realize this future. 
                                New technologies, such as holograms, AR, AI, etc., are a particular 
                                class of technology - emerging. These emerging technologies are 
                                those technical innovations that represent progressive developments 
                                within a field for competitive advantage. In the context of education, 
                                they may be used to support learning and teaching, or both. 
                                They may be referred to as learning technologies when used 
                                in support of learning. They may be referred to as instructional 
                                technologies when used in support of teaching. There is a great 
                                deal of debate surrounding the use of emerging technologies in education. 
                              </p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">Some believe they offer vast potential for 
                                enhancing learning and teaching, while others are concerned 
                                about the potential negative impact they may have on the 
                                quality of education. No doubt, emerging technologies are 
                                changing the way we live and work. They are also changing 
                                the way we learn and teach. It is essential to embrace 
                                these changes and use them to our advantage. As more and more students have 
                                access to devices such as laptops and tablets, it is important that educators 
                                make use of these tools to engage students in learning.</p>

                                    There are a number of ways in which emerging technologies 
                                    can be used effectively in education. For example, online 
                                    resources can be used to supplement classroom teaching. 
                                    Students can be given assignments that require them to research a 
                                    topic using online resources, or they can be given access to online 
                                    learning tools such as Canvas.

                                    In addition, emerging learning technologies (ELTs) can be used to create more interactive 
                                    and engaging learning experiences. For example, students can use
                                    Augmented Reality (AR) to explore augmented environments. Alternatively,
                                    they can use Virtual Reality (VR) to experience simulations of real-world scenarios.
                                </p>

                                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                                    I envision ELTs helping address the digital
                                    divide by providing access to educational resources for all learners from all backgrounds.
                                    ELTs are particularly important for the future of education as
                                    they offer new ways for students to learn by giving them access
                                    to new types of content and practices of interacting with that content.
                                    Ultimately, I believe that emerging technologies have the potential
                                    to transform education for the better. By making use of these
                                    tools, we can provide students with a more engaging and interactive learning experience.
                                </p>

                                    Although Emerging learning technologies make our lives easier,
                                    there may be pitfalls regarding adoption, benefits, use, privacy, data ethics.
                                    The future cannot be predicted; as such, it is often difficult
                                    to gauge whether a piece of technology is just hype or has enormous
                                    future potential especially in education. Are learner and instructors willing to adopt 
                                    a new technology with so much uncertainty about its future potential? How do we measure 
                                    their impact on learning? And for what time length?
                                    One question I keep coming back to everyone and then is;
                                    when and at what point does a piece of new and shiny technology considered emerging?
                                    I look forward to answering this question in my ELT retrospect essay. Will the future of education be holograms?
                                    Only time will tell.

                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">At the beginning of the class, 
                                I envisioned emerging technologies bridging the digital divide 
                                by making educational tools accessible to learners from diverse 
                                backgrounds. After learning the trends and issues surrounding 
                                emerging technologies, I am hesitant to say this will be the case, 
                                at least for the foreseeable future. Although the potential for bridging 
                                the digital divide exists, emerging technologies, sadly are expensive 
                                and require sufficient experience and expertise to operate. 
                                The Oculus VR headset is an example of such technology. 
                                Given the cost and overhead required to operate these in 
                                a classroom or school, I do not anticipate wide adoption anytime soon, 
                                let alone close the enormous digital divide between rural and urban learners.

                                </p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">I raised a few questions at the beginning 
                                of the class and have returned retrospectively with a 
                                few closing thoughts. Are learners and 
                                instructors willing to adopt new technology with so 
                                much uncertainty about its future potential? My response 
                                is that it depends on where, when, and what. Where is the 
                                technology being adopted? K-12 or Higher Education. 
                                The setting or environment would dictate the goodwill 
                                for such technology. UF received the HiPerGator donation 
                                with an enormous amount of fun fairs and razzmatazz 
                                because the goodwill for AI existed. Timing is also 
                                important when it comes to adopting new technologies.
                                Given the ebbs and flows of new technology referenced 
                                by the Gartner HyperCycle, the timing of technology 
                                is an important factor. Consider 3D glasses for movies 
                                at the cinema, for instance.</p>

                                    How do we measure the impact of emerging technologies on learning, and for how long? 
                                    Well, this is a 6-million-dollar question. Measuring the impact of any technology on 
                                    learning is an enormous task. It is difficult to say for certain that any technology 
                                    impact learning and to what extent.

                                    Many start-ups have emerged on the premise of

                                    teaching and learning, so there is something to say about that aspect of the 
                                    teaching and learning process. For now, this question will remain unanswered
                                    till stakeholders and practitioners agree on how to tackle this 600-pound elephant.
