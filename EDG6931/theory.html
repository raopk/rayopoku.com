                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">Part 1: Reflection

                                The Gartner Hype-cycle is a graphical representation of the maturity and adoption of technology or innovation (Fenn et al. 2017), drawn as a circle with five parts: innovations trigger new ideas (innovation trigger), emerging technologies create interest and excitement (peak of inflated expectations), and maturity (trough of disillusionment) starts to appear for some products and services as solutions are being developed (and customers begin to adopt these), mainstream acceptance (slope of enlightenment) takes place when most customers have adopted technology or idea, but it is still not the dominant form for an entire industry. Finally, there is fatigue (plateau of productivity), where the newness has worn off. According to the Gartner Hype-cycle, each stage is characterized by a different level of adoption, risk, and rewards. An innovation's hype cycle mainly depends on the domain or industry of adoption.
                                
                                The education sector has always lagged behind other industries in the use of technology. Some studies have suggested a seven-year average gap between an invention and its adoption in Education. The delayed adoption of innovation is not in itself wrong. Technology and Education have had a delicate song and dance. The implication of a piece of technology on teaching and learning cannot be quickly assessed or evaluated and, in most cases, take years of experimentation and research. For instance, AR, VR, and 3D were developed and adopted by the US military (Cipresso et al., 2018) long before their adoption in the education industry. The hype-cycle articles for Emerging Learning Technologies offer insights into emerging educational trends, including discussions on how they fit into digital literacies in education contexts.</p>

                            <p data-aos="fade-up">Part 2: Theoretical Framework

                                The theory of Multiple Intelligences (Gardner, 1983) posits that eight different types of intelligence have a unique combination. This theory provides a solid rationale for using AR, VR, MR, or 3D to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning because it suggests that different people learn best in different ways. For instance, some people may learn best by seeing things in three dimensions, while others may learn best by hearing or interacting with things. By using AR, VR, MR, or 3D, educators can provide learners with experiences tailored to their individual learning needs and preferences.
                                
                                Situating cognition is a theoretical concept that may provide a solid rationale for using AR-based instruction. Situated cognition is the idea that learning is situated in, and mediated by, the real-world context in which it occurs (Roth, 2001; Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989). This theory suggests that learners learn best when they can apply their knowledge to real-world tasks and problems (Wilson and Clark, 2008). AR-based instruction can provide learners with opportunities to do just that by situating learning content in the real world and providing learners with tools to interact with that content in meaningful ways..</p>

                                    Part 3: Empirical Research

One study that directly addresses the practical application of AR technology in the classroom is the study conducted by 
Yen Wen (2021). The study titled "Augmented reality enhanced cognitive engagement: designing classroom-based Collaborative 
learning activities for young language learners" used a mixed-methods approach, collecting data from both quantitative and qualitative sources.
 The quantitative data was collected through pre-and post-tests of the students' cognitive engagement, and the qualitative data 
 through focus groups and semi-structured interviews with teachers. 
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up">
                                    The study shows that AR can be an effective tool for teaching and learning, 
                                    but some limitations should be considered when using AR in the classroom. The study results showed an improvement in students' levels of cognitive engagement in AR-supported activities. 
                                    The study also found some limitations to using AR in the classroom, such as compared with other tools (e.g., Apple Pages used by the control class), students need a longer time to get used to AR-supported learning and make AR artifacts. More time should be reserved to interact with the surroundings and discuss with one another. The study only sampled a small number of students and teachers - 52 and 2, respectively - which limits the generalizability of the results. Despite these limitations, Wen (2021) provides valuable insights into using AR in the classroom.
