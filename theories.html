								<p>The Rise experience designed by Carlow University is a comprehensive module that introduces learners to online course development and could be adopted and used in various learning environments. It is self-paced and places significant emphasis on content mastery.</p>

								<p>Section 2 of the module introduces students to common models in instructional design. In the quick overview of course development, the statement &quot;these processes are not meant to be rigid&#8230;&quot; stood out. Reflecting on the class discussion on the Hyflex (Beatty, 2019) scenario, the common sentiment was to use the design process as a framework and guide for Dr. Smith's chemistry class focusing on flexibility. The need to revisit, evaluate and revise the course was essential, and that the process was not a &quot;one size fits all.&quot;</p>

								<p>The learner analysis is an essential initial step in a needs assessment analysis (Ren A, 2018). Right questions in a learning analysis will provide insight into the felt needs of the learner. I plan to design a disability course module for graduate students at the College of Education in my ID project. In my learner analysis, I provided answers on who my learner was &ndash; graduate students, what barriers do they have? &ndash; working professionals with limited time, and how do I assess what the learners already know? &ndash; quizzes and assignments. I will also use Bloom's taxonomy to guide this week's assignment on writing learning objectives and alignments.</p>

								<p>The last module in Section 2 was on Instructional design (ID) models. ID models are guide rails for developing efficient online courses. Notably among ID models are the ADDIE model and the Backwards design model. ADDIE encompasses the instructional design process - Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation, which I will be using in my ID project. In reviewing the Rise experience, I learned that the ADDIE Model is not suitable for every scenario. Other models, such as the backward design and design think model, exist for various situations. The Backward Design model starts with desired goals that drive the adopted methods and assessment. The backward design model was my recommendation to Dr. Rhonda Smith from the Hyflex discussion. In identifying the desired goals for all students &ndash; online and in-person, it is much easier to adopt a teaching technique that is beneficial to all students. I was first introduced to the Design Thinking Model, which I use in my data visualization work first unbeknownst to me that it was an ID model. I use the five stages of design &ndash; Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test in my daily data analysis and visualization work.</p>

								<p>Gagn&eacute;'s nine events of instruction (Gagn&eacute;, 1985) have been the gold standard for instructions. I facilitated a STEM summer camp for middle schoolers two years ago and used Gagne's technique effectively. I developed a &quot;call and response&quot; chant as an ice breaker to gain my students' attention. The chant made my student motivated and invested in the instruction. Afterward, I repeated the lesson's objective and sometimes required them to read it aloud from their camp textbook.  To simulates recall of prior learning, I asked them questions. The content was presented in an interactive approach with the student. This interactive approach worked because students did their readings for the lesson before they came to class. I explained problematic areas to help them understand the material.  During the practical session, students were grouped into teams. Each team coded on the team iPads and build robots. In the end, I gave each team my feedback and assessed their performance.
