									<h1>Lesson Plan<br />

									<p>To effectively deliver a lesson, an instructor must rely on the lesson plans. Lesson plans are the maps instructors use to guide any instructional method. Objectives, goals and activities are outlined in the lesson plans</p>

								<h4>Module: Learning Disability Awareness</h4>

<p>The initial survey results and interviews from the needs assessment indicated that 75% of respondents expressed the need for an introductory module to guide their awareness and familiarity with various Learning Disabilities (LDs). The survey results further indicated that students were only aware of a few LDs and expressed their desire to learn more, but time constraints might hinder the increased willingness to learn. The goal in response to the need will be to include a pod size/mini-module on LDs to the existing curriculum instead of designing a separate one. The module will introduce students to LDs over a three-hour timeframe to reduce information overload. Objectives:  This module's instructional objectives will follow the understanding or comprehension and application of Bloom's cognitive objectives taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001). The assumption here is that students do not have any prior knowledge, and with these objectives, activities will be designed to direct students to achieve related goals (Morrison, Ross, Kalman &amp; Kemp, 2019).</p>

<p>The learning objectives for the entire module are as follows:</p>

<p>Students will discuss the historical context of learning disabilities (ADA). Students will identify various learning disabilities. Students will identify LD-assisted technology and concepts. Students will demonstrate &quot;Chunked&quot; reading passages. Students will apply knowledge of learning disabilities.</p>

<p>The learning plan below for pod one will address the first learning objective. Students will discuss the historical context of learning disabilities and Accessibility (ADA) at the end of this pod/mini-module. Readings:  Two articles - The history of ADA (2020) and A Historical Preface to the Americans with Disabilities Act by Berkowitz (1994) - will be assigned in Perusall for reading and discussions. The discussions will be graded on the level of student engagement, the depth of the conversation, and the number of external related readings students introduced, i.e., real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>A Historical Preface to the Americans with Disabilities Act by Edward Berkowitz (1994) https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-policy-history/article/abs/historical-preface-to-the-americans-with-disabilities-act/6F0DE9F483A374591F3AB73D6F90962A</p>

<p>A History of ADA (2020) https://dredf.org/about-us/publications/the-history-of-the-ada/ Videos: An interactive video in PlayPosit to present a general overview of the history of ADA.  Title: A general overview of the ADA history. Learning Activities: Discussions, Quizzes, Assignment submission.  This module will introduce students to the historical context of learning disabilities and Accessibility (ADA).  Introduction Students will understand the course's objectives and how they apply to their motivation and requirement for taking the course. They will describe their personal goals for the module as they relate to the course objectives in their introductory post on a discussion board. Students will understand the objectives of the course. They will answer multiple choice quiz questions based on the course syllabus and agree to its terms.</p>

<p>A general overview of ADA  Instructor introduction PlayPosit video. Preliminary multiple-choice quiz. Students' reflections after each section will be graded.</p>

<p>Discussion Journal discussion on Perusall.</p>

<p>Assignment  Students will write a two-page reflection on the history of learning disabilities in higher education. Submission is due a week after class. Guidelines for discussions  You can start a new annotation thread in this Perusall reading assignment by highlighting text, asking questions, or posting a comment. You can also add a reply to an existing thread. More information is available on the Perusall website (Links to an external site.) Scoring: Discussions will be scored based on participation. There should be notes made mainly related to the topics mentioned above or areas.</p>

<p> Rubric for the essay:  Important: You must participate in the discussion to receive full points. You will only submit your assignment once it is fully complete. If you forget something and need to resubmit, upload all files, including those you already uploaded and submit one complete homework submission. Keep in mind you will only be given two opportunities to submit. You must pay attention to details and ensure you have uploaded everything before submitting your assignment. If all your files re not included in your final submission, you will not get full credit for the assignment.</p>

<p>Essay Criteria Ratings Completeness 4 points:  Exhibits critical thinking and includes real-life scenarios. 3 points: Minimal exhibition of critical thinking and real-life applications. 2 points:  More room for improvement. No points: Incomplete Evidence 4 points:  Included at least two supporting pieces of evidence. 3 points:  At least supporting evidence. No point:  No supporting evidence. Length of response 4 points:  a two-page, double-spaced. References included. 3 points:  more room for improvement. 0 point:  does not meet this criterion.</p>
