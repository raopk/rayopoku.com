                                  <p data-aos="fade-up">
                                    At the beginning of 2010’s, a strong push towards inclusion and equality led to a
                                    growing call for educating students with learning disabilities with non-disability
                                    students in the same classroom. Consequently, general education teachers,
                                    many of which were inadequately trained or prepared became the primary instructors of
                                    all these students many of which (Browell et al. 2006, pp 17). The lack of learning disability
                                    training in most teacher education curriculum is evident in the lack of awareness among teachers.
                                    According to Rosenzweig (2009), there is a growing concern that teacher and instructional designer
                                     preparations and training with lies on university education are failing to meet the current changes
                                     in our educational system. The failure is observed in the lack of awareness of learning disabilities
                                     among teachers who graduate from their programs. The Foundational classes such as Instructional
                                     Design - EME6609 is created to introduce students to the idea and tenet of instructional design (ID).
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up">
                                    It is a beginner’s guide into the world of ID for many students.
                                    It is usually followed by an advanced course in ID however, many students are not obligated to go that route.
                                    As such students complete the course without awareness or understanding of varying learning disabilities.
                                    As a result, students with learning disabilities do not
                                    receive the “appropriate” education for their needs (Lipsky & Gartner, 1996, pp 780).
                                    The inclusion of a learning disability awareness module will
                                    ensure that upon completion of their first semester classes,
                                    college of ed students will gain knowledge to design instructions
                                    that accommodate all learners, including those with learning disabilities.
                                    Essentially, this project seeks to develop an instructional design module on
                                    learning disability (LD) awareness.

                                        The needs assessment survey instruments were sent out to about 10 college college of Ed students.
                                        Of the 10 invited to participate in the survey, 4 responded so far and the survey is open for two more weeks.
                                        At the current 40% response rate, half (50%) of total respondents had little to no knowledge on inclusive
                                        education and students with learning disability issues. Also, Seventy-five percent of respondents expected
                                        to learn about LD in their first class. Also, fifty percent of all respondents expressed the desire
                                        to include LD in their design but lacked the awareness and skill to do so.
                                        In addition, 25% of respondents expected to learn about LD issues as part of the first class.
                                        Majority of respondents so far do not plan to enroll in the advanced ID class. Of all respondents, there were 75% Female.

                                    A majority of respondents had Masters and professional level certificates (75%)
                                    and had an average teaching and/or instructional design experience of 4 years.
                                    The largest motivation for enrolling in their first class was gaining understanding
                                    in foundational classes (75%) and compulsory spring class (25%).

                                Given the lack of awareness of inclusive education and students with LD issues as shown
                                by 75% of survey respondents so far, and the desire to learn, a module on design for
                                students with LD’s should be added to the foundational Instructional design class.
                                This will create awareness among students who enroll in only the introductory class
                                and equip them with the knowledge on issues to consider when designing instructions and teaching.
                                A goal will be to include a module in the before the beginning of the project or as
                                part of the initial historical reading material.
                              </p>

                                In a recent discussion, a colleague mentioned how difficult it was for her to
                                identify a student in her class with a learning disability and remarked that the student
                                was unwilling to ask for help. This speaks to the issue at hand and equipping teachers
                                with the skill to handle these issues and asking the right questions so that students
                                with LD’s don't feel isolated and singled out would help.

                                They will acquire knowledge in close captions in video presentations, “chunked”

                              The College of Education graduate student class is a graduate level course with students in Masters and PhD programs. The typical student is an adult with graduate
                              level course load and some of whom are working professional by day and student by night. As such, they make optimal use of their limited time daily.
                              Their commitment to enrolling in class is indicative of their resilience and tenacity. It will serve them a great deal, if a module on inclusive education is added to each class they take.
                              This could be broken in bits i.e. pods on Canvas for easy consumption. A third pod on LD could be added to each module in connection with the main topic.
                              Students in the EME6609 have extensive and broad experience with graduate level coursework and will find it easier to acquaint themselves with issues facing students with LD’s. Plus, more than half of respondents have indicated the desire to learn about LD issues.
